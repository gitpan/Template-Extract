This is the README file for Template::Extract, a module for extracting
data structure from TT2-rendered documents, effectively reversing the
process() function.

Please type "perldoc Template::Extract" after installation to see
the module usage information.

* Installation

Template::Extract uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v		# optional; see SIGNATURE for details
perl Makefile.PL
make			# or 'nmake' on Windows
make test
make install

If you have Module::Build installed, this also works:

cpansign -v		# optional; see SIGNATURE for details
perl Build.PL
./Build			# or 'perl Build' on Windows
./Build test
./Build install
